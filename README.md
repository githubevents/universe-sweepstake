We've enabled Discussions here for you to ask and answer questions about each session as well as connect with one another during the event. Engineering teams and GitHub experts across the world will be online during each of the sessions.

Remember, we want to keep the discussions' area a friendly and welcoming place for everyone taking part in the event, and **focused specifically and solely on the topic(s) covered in the GitHub Universe sessions**. Therefore, please respect the [Event Code of Conduct]( https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-event-code-of-conduct)  and be wonderful to each other.

This is a civilized place for connecting with other event attendees, and Hubbers from across the world taking part in the events. By participating in this community, you are agreeing to the same [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service) that apply to GitHub.com, as well as the GitHub Event [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/githubevents/Universe2021/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

ü§ûüèΩ We aim to do our best to answer most questions, but it's possible not all questions will get answered. The discussion area will be for live interaction and Q&A for session themes and topics. We will be locking the discussions to make them read-only after the event so you‚Äôll be able to refer back to them after Universe has commenced.
